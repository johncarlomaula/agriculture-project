# Optimizing Agricultural Production

**Project Description:** In this project, I use k-means clustering to discover patterns in agriculture data before building a predictive model to recommend suitable crops to plant depending on a given set of farming and environmental conditions. 

**Main Goals:**
- Explore and analyze the data
- Use a clustering algorithm to find patterns in the data
- Build a predictive model to recommend suitable crops for planting
